## About Explorer Application

The Pando Explorer is a [blockchain explorer](https://explorer.pandoproject.org/) which allows users look up, confirm and validate transactions on the Pando blockchain. By entering an address into the search box, you can view the balance, value and all the transactions made through that address.
The explorer also allows a user to check the details of a transaction with the transaction hash. Once youâ€™ve pasted the hash into the search bar, a series of transaction details will appear. These include the type of the transaction, the height of the block that includes the transaction, and the timestamp when the transaction was finalized on-chain.
With smart contract support enabled on the Pando blockchain, the Pando Explorer was redesigned to more easily inspect and monitor smart contracts on Pando Mainnet. Similar to Etherscan.io, the Pando Explorer allows developers to upload and verify the source code of their smart contracts, query the read-only interface of the smart contracts, and record the Pando VM returns and emitted events for ease of debugging. please explorer site to know more https://explorer.pandoproject.org/.
